# Creating your own clone of a repository, committing and pull requests

* Step 1. Create a github account.
 
* Step 2. In GitHub go to 
https://github.com/RichardMorris/SACDungeon

* Step 3. In the top right corner, press the Fork button to create a copy of the project in your own GitHub account.

  * This will make your own copy of the code.

* Step 4. Add your name to the list below, use the pencil icon in the top right to do it

1. Richard Morris - Grand Wizard
2. Paul Smith
3. Olly E - Dev and all round lovely chap
4. Jamie Lias
5. Courtney-Jade Rowden
6. Andrew Maclaren - The supreme coder
7. Peter Newing - the puzzle solver
8. Adam C - The dark souls of programmers
9. A Mathiesen
10. Lewis James
11. Paddy-Shaw
12. David Brooks
13. Michael Algie
14. Emil Bostrom
15. James Barnfather
16. Alex Cooper
17. Harvey Lloyd
18. Will G-S
19. Peter Craze
20. D Edgeworth
21. Max Walker
22. Lexie Johnston
23. Cai Taylor
24. Dayana Sanchez
25. Andy Watson
26. Adam Allerton
27. Will Best
* Step 5. *Commit and Push* 

On GitHub at the bottom of the edit page there is a box to Commit pages. Fill in details and press Commit changes.

* Step 6. Create a pull request in github

This will be a request to the owner of the upstream repositiory (Richard) to pull you code and merge into my code base.

  * Click the *Pull Request* or *Contribute* button
  * Select *create pull request*
  * On new screen select *create pull request* again.
  * On new form fill in the title and description (just add name will do)
  * Click the *create pull request* the request will be submitted to the main repository for me to review.

Once done you are free to change anything. Only sensible changes will be accepted.

## Contributing to a shared repositry

Having to do pull requests every time you make a change is a bit to much work, instead you can become a *contributor* of a project
and push without seeking aproval. The manager of the project can make you a contributor.

* Step 7. Become a contributor
  * Send me an email with your GitHub username
  * I will then send you a request 
  * Accept the request 
  * You should now appear in the list of contributors of the project

* Step 8. Now edit the master document
  *  You should now be able to go to the master repository https://github.com/RichardMorris/SACDungeon/ and edit there.
  *  Commit the changes. Make sure you commit to the *main* branch.

There may be a problem where two different prople try to commit at the same time causing a *conflit* 
this might make it so you can commit a change but not push it to the main branch. Resolving conflicts is an advanced issue.

## Connecting a thind party editor to github

Normally you don't work directly on the github page, but use another application including:
 
* Using *git*  on a command line - this is the basic system that all other programs work with. It is powerful but complex. 
  * Git For Windows: gives a minimal bash commandline that allows git commands https://gitforwindows.org/
  * Linux: `sudo apt install git` will install it
  * Windows subsystem for Linux: we can use this on college PCs, install ubuntu from the Windows store.  
* github desktop a gui app that allows inspection of changes etc. https://desktop.github.com/
* Many Editors come with git as standard, or allow it using a plugin 
  * Eclipse
  * IntelliJ
  * VS Code
  * Atom
  * Visual Studio

Once you have decided on an editor you will use 

* Step 9. Connect your prefered editor to the master repository
  * Install the correct git software for your editor
  * Create a  Personal Access Tokens, a safer versions of a password. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens, create one with *repo* access 
  * In you app *Checkout* the repository using the the clone url https://github.com/RichardMorris/SACDungeon.git
  * This will require your login credentials and Personal Access Tokens as password
  * If things work fine it should create a new folder with a copy of all the files in this repository

* Step 10. Get the latest version from the repository
  * Use `git pull` to retreive the latest version from the reposity and merge it with your changes
  * Do this regually as problems emerge if your version and the master version differ
  * Here *pull* copies changes from the master into your repository. A *pull request* is asking someone to pull changes from your copy into their version, typicall the master.
 
 * Step 11. Make an edit and push
   * Make an edit to the readme file
   * You may need to stage the file so that git knows its ready to be committed, `git add` can do this or use an IDE tool
   * Commit your change - this updates your local copy of the repository
   * *Push* your change this sends it upto the master repository
   * If all goes well your change appears, you might get some failures, a message "not fast forward" means you probably need to do a `git pull` first
   * You can do multiple commits before pushing.
